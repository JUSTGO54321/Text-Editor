# Text-Editor
Using tkinter to make a text editor and recreate Notepad.

In order to run the app, open "Notepad 2.0.py" and run the file.

Functions:
- Typing lots of text
- Minimizing and Maximizing
- Saving as a .txt file
- Opening other .txt files
- Looks like Notepad

There's a lot more work to be done on this.
